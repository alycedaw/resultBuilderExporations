/// @resultBuilder Definition:
///
/// A result builder is a special definition of a *transformation* that can be
/// applied to a void returning function.
///
/// The transformation gathers all of the unused expressions of the function as
/// parameters and calculates a return type.
///
/// Special transformations applied to code that runs conditionally or in a loop to
/// gather unesed expressions in those blocks and allow for the type information
/// of all of these expression to be preserved in the final result.
